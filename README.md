# Hi! Our next Sphinxer
This is a test for you before becoming an amazing developer @sphinx!

- In this repo, you'll have a `package.json` file that configured with `chai`, `mocha` and `sinon`
- We pre-setting up a `npm test` command, you should run that command, then you'll see it is failing
- Our requirement is just simple: **Make it pass!**
- Other requirements will come-in by the interviewer(s)!
- There are few levels of the time box:
    
    - Less than 5 minutes: You are amazing!
    - Less than 15 minutes: Awesome!
    - Less than 30 minutes: Great!

---
*Googling is allowed :heart:*

*Need other library? no problem, just `npm install` them*

*There are 4 levels of this test (on branch `master`, `level-2`, `level-3` and `level-4`). So if you are confident about yourself, why stop there?*

So see you in the interview!
Happy coding and testing! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
